			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<hr>

			<p>
				My name is Brad Lawson. I have been married to my wonderful wife Aliecia for 17 years. We have three children: Allie, Ryle, and Dougie. I like to spend time with my family. We enjoy playing games, watching movies, and just hanging out. I love being outdoors. I love to fish. I like to take walks, ride bikes, and hike. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I have spent a lot of time in school over the years; slowly but steadily, working to finish my degree. I finished my bachelors degree in 2015 in religion. Due to various circumstances it took me a while to finish, but I stayed at it and I accomplished my goal
			</p>
			<p>
				My previous work experiences are vast. I most recently pastored a small church in Palm Bay Florida. I did this for the past four years, while simultaneously working as an Aquatics technician. I have a ton of experience in the "green" industry. I have experience in almost everything one can do in the industry. This includes: the basics (mowing, edging, trimming and shrub maintenance). I have built retaining walls, paver patios and walkways. I have worked on irrigation systems. I am have installed landscape lighting. I have even installed synthetic golf greens and playgrounds. My most recent employment has included lawn and ornamental fertilization, and I am certified in the state of Florida for Aquatics and Wetland management. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I am beginning a new journey as a full-stack web developer. I am currently taking the UCF coding bootcamp and am looking forward to become a full-stack web developer. This is my first project. I am excited to become apart of a team of developers, continue to learn and hone my skills, and become a vital part of a growing organization

				Take a look around and contact me with any questions, opportunities, or even a good joke.
